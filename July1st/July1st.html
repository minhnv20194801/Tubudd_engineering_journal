        <h2>Morning</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Start the day at 12:00AM cause I decided to watch England vs Slovakia in Euro 2024 (ends up sleeping
                much later than expected since England really like to play extra time for no reason?)</li>
            <li>Actually start the day at 6:30AM to prepare for work</li>
            <li>Arrive at work 10 minutes early to see nobody have opened the door, decide to track back to nearby
                supermarket for some water. Luckily, by the time I get back, people have started to come to open the
                door</li>
            <li>Introduce myself to other colleagues and start to get familiar with the environment</li>
            <li>Waiting for the company CTO to give instructions, try to learn elixir - a new programming language by
                studying this document: <a
                    href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/introduction.html">https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/introduction.html</a>
            </li>
            <li>End the morning by receiving instructions from CTO just as I was having lunch</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Evening</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Waking up! Start the evening by skimming through the github link given by the CTO</li>
            <li>Spend about 15-30 minutes installing Livebook, it's not working...</li>
            <li>Appearantly, my system was missing something called wxwidgets? Installing it and everything seems fine
                :D</li>
            <li>Reading through the first chapter, feeling great!, until I notice that I can't seem to push the files to
                my repository</li>
            <li>OH DEAR! HAVING 2 GITHUB ACCOUNTS A MISTAKE T_T. I CAN'T SEEMS TO FIND WAY TO LOGOUT OF THE CURRENT
                ACCOUNT T_T!!!! SEND HELP!!!!!</li>
            <li>After about 30 minutes or so, things looks fine :D, problem resolved :D. (TODO: merge 2 git account into
                1)</li>
            <li>Reading through the documents, things are similar to what I've studied at school, but it still kinda
                refreshing to relearn and have a better understand of them</li>
            <li>Been reading and watching videos for two hours straight, I'm bored T_T, oh? What's an Engineering
                Journal? They said to use markdown but markup would be ok right? RIGHT? Might use this opportunity to
                have relearn a bit of HTML. This should be a good closure for the day too</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Remark</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Really need to merge the 2 git accounts</li>
            <li>Need to adapt fast and speed up the progress</li>
            <li>Keeping this journal up maybe?</li>
            <li>Maybe make this journal look better? Maybe not lol</li>
            <li>I wish I will have a good time at Tubudd</li>
        </ul>
